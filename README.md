# machine-learning
Robust and scaleable machine-learning for text classification based on support vector machines

Welcome, this souce code was developed during our thesis (Master in Computer Science - University of Dortmund). We developed a new 
tooklit for machine learning usig hiden markov chains and suport vector machines

Because machine learning became extremly poular in 2017, we deciced to publish our work as open source.

Plese feel free to use and improve our codebase
