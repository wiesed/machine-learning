Robust ans Scaleable machine-learning for text classification based on Support Vector Machines

Welcome, this souce code was developed during our Thesis (Master in Computer Science - University of Dortmund). We developed a new 
tooklit for machine learning usig Hiden Markov Chains and Suport Vector Maschines

Because machine learning became extremly poular in 2017 we deciced to pubih our wotk as open source

Plese feel free to use and impove our codebase
